# A Console Function that Returns a Value
The purpose of this proposal is to introduce a `console` function that can fit inline with existing code rather than having to be a stand-alone statement. A function like this could simplify the developer experience and reduce the potential of human error. 

# The Case
Many of the commonly used features introduced since ES6 have been expression alternatives to block statements or new features that support an expressive style of writing. For example:
	    - `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
	    - `Promise`, `await`
	    - `() => ({})`
	    - Rest and Spread Operators 
As a result, a lot of code is written so that one expression can feed into another with concise syntax. For Example: 

```javascript
const pick = (...keys) => obj =>
  Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(obj).filter(entry => keys.includes(entry[0]))
  );
```

```javascript
const groupBy = groupingPropName => (groups, obj) => ({
  ...groups,
  [obj[groupingPropName]]: [...(groups[groupingPropName] || []), obj],
});

const groupped = arr.reduce(groupBy('type'), {});
```

`console.log`  does not *fit* in these examples. While `console.log` [is technically a CallExpression]([AST explorer]https://astexplorer.net/#/gist/6fa0ec9e42ef68f854fdecde72d1def8/dae159eaee59235de9d14109c9b8f95467d212b8) it is most often treated as a Statement because it returns `undefined`. As a result, anyone writing in an expressive style has to rewrite their code to accommodate for that result. It is a cumbersome and tedious process. More than that, though, all of that writing and rewriting introduces new opportunities for typos and errors. 

# A Solution
I want to propose a new `console` function. It takes in any number of values, logs all of the values, but *only* returns the first value. Something like:
```javascript
( v, ...rest ) => { 
    console.log( v, â€¦rest );
    return v;
}
``` 
By doing this, the logging function could be used inline with just about any expression without requiring a rewrite. It would have no functional impact on the code around it. 

For the following examples I am going use this new function, and call it `console.exp`.

# Use Cases
### In Function Composition
```javascript
var userID = getUserId(
    JSON.parse(console.exp(localStorage.getItem( 'user' ))) 
);
```
<details>
    <summary>With <code>console.log</code></summary>

```javascript
const user = localStorage.getItem( 'user' );
console.log(user)

var userID = getUserId(
    JSON.parse(user) 
);
```

</details>

### Around Dot Chaining
```javascript
const result = console.exp(['1', '2', 'zero' , 3, 4, 5]
    .map(parseNumbers)
    .filter(removeEvens)) // `exp` will log the result of map & filter
    .reduce(( acc, v ) => Math.max(acc, v));
```
<details>
    <summary>With <code>console.log</code></summary>

```javascript
const filteredRes = ['1', '2', 'zero' , 3, 4, 5]
    .map(parseNumbers)
    .filter(removeEvens)
console.log(filteredRes)

const result = filteredRes
    .reduce(( acc, v ) => Math.max(acc, v));
```

</details>

### Pass through Promise.then
```javascript
fetch(url)
    .then( res => res.json() )
    .then( console.exp )
    .then( calculate )
```
<details>
    <summary>With <code>console.log</code></summary>

```javascript
fetch(url)
    .then( res => res.json() )
    .then( res => ( console.log(res), res ) )
    .then( calculate )
```

</details>

---
### Returning an ObjectExpression
```javascript
const pickAndFormatTransaction = ( {
        amount,
        date
} ) => console.exp( {
        amount: console.exp(Number( amount ))
            ? formatCurrency( amount ) 
            : amount,
        date: console.tap(moment( date ).format( 'DD/MM/YYY' ))
} );
```
<details>
    <summary>With <code>console.log</code></summary>

```javascript
const pickAndFormatTransaction = ({ amount, date }) => {
  const isNumber = Number(amount);
  console.log(isNumber);

  const formattedDate = moment(date).format('DD/MM/YYY');
  console.log(formattedDate);
  const res = {
    amount: isNumber ? formatCurrency(amount) : amount,
    date: formattedDate,
  };
  console.log(res);

  return res;
};
```
